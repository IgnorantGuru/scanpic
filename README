README for scanpic


OVERVIEW
========

Scanpic allows you to scan images of a specified size from the command line 
without use of a GUI and without needing to crop the image afterward. I 
wrote this script when I had hundreds of old pics of various sizes to scan, 
and I didnâ€™t want to have to crop them all individually.
